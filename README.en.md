### Application Component

1. **Initial Render:**
   - The application component is displayed for the first time.
   - `useState` hooks initialize the `userData` state to an empty object (`{ email: '', number: '' }`) and the `isLoading` state to `false` (not loading).
   - The app displays an empty container with centered layout.

2. **User Interaction with the Form:**
   - The user interacts with the Form component by entering an email address (required) and, optionally, a number.
   - The Form component updates the `userData` state of the application component with the validated form data (email address and number) via the `setData` function passed as a prop.
   - The `isLoad` function is called (its value obtained from the Form component), which sets the `isLoading` state of the App component to `false`, indicating that data fetching is complete.

3. **Conditional Rendering and Data Display:**
   - The application component re-renders due to state changes (`userData` and `isLoading`).
   - Conditional rendering checks the current state of `isLoading`:
     - If `isLoading` is `false` (not loading), the program moves to the next condition.
     - The conditional rendering then checks the length of `userData.email`:
       - If `userData.email` has a length (i.e., an email address was entered), this indicates successful data retrieval.
       - The `DataUser` component is displayed, receiving the `userData` property which contains the retrieved user data (email address and number). This component displays user data on the screen.
       - If `userData.email` has no length (i.e., no email address was entered), the `DataUser` component is not displayed and no data is shown.

4. **Toaster Component:**
   - The `Toaster` component (from `react-hot-toast`) is used to display alerts or messages triggered by various events (e.g., form validation errors, successful data retrieval).


### Form Component

The Form component manages several state variables using `useState`:

1. **State Variables:**
   - `values`: Stores current form data (email address and number).
   - `errors`: Stores any validation errors encountered during form submission.
   - `formData`: Stores validated form data before sending it to the backend.
   - `isLoading`: Indicates whether the component is currently fetching data from the backend.

2. **useEffect Hooks:**
   - **First useEffect:** Depends on `isLoading` and updates the parent component or global state with the current loading status.
   - **Second useEffect:** Depends on `formData` and triggers the fetch process whenever the form data changes (after successful validation).

### User Interaction and Form Processing

1. **Handling Input Changes:**
   - `handleChange` function:
     - Updates the `values` state with the new value from the changed input.
     - If the modified input is "number", it removes any hyphens before saving the value to ensure clean data for validation.

2. **Handling Form Submission:**
   - `onSubmitForm` function:
     - Calls `e.preventDefault()` to prevent the default form submission behavior.
     - Validates the form data using the `validFormData` function.
     - Checks for the presence and format of the required email field.
     - Updates the `errors` state with any validation errors returned by `validFormData`.
     - If there are no validation errors, it calls the `isHasKeyValue` function to check if the key "number" has a value, and removes it if it doesn't before sending it to the backend.

### Data Fetching and Error Handling

1. **Fetching Data:**
   - The second `useEffect` hook triggers the fetch process when `formData` changes:
     - If the email field in `formData` is empty, it exits without making a request.
     - Defines an asynchronous function `getUserByEmail` that takes user data (`formData`) as input.
   
2. **Inside `getUserByEmail`:**
   - Sets `isLoading` to `true` to indicate the loading state.
   - Calls the `getUser` function to retrieve user data from the backend using the provided email.
   - Updates the state with the fetched user data using `setData`.
   - Handles potential errors during the request:
     - If the error message is "canceled", it returns a success message indicating that the previous request was canceled.
     - Otherwise, it displays an error message based on the error response data.
   - Resets the form state in the `finally` block:
     - Clears the form fields.
     - Sets `isLoading` to `false` to indicate that loading is complete.

### Display and User Feedback

1. **Form Display:**
   - Displays a form with email address and number fields.
   - Marks the email field as required.
   - Displays validation errors in red below the corresponding input fields.
   - Shows a loading indicator (Loader component) while fetching data from the backend.

### General Workflow

1. The user interacts with the form by entering an email address (required) and an optional number.
2. The user clicks Submit.
3. The form data is validated.
4. If validation passes, a request is made to fetch user data by email.
5. A loading indicator is displayed while fetching data.
6. Once data is successfully retrieved, it is passed to the parent component using `setData`.


##### Server ######
Here is a revised and corrected version of the server setup description for your README:

---

### Server Setup

1. **Express Initialization:**
   - `Express` is imported and an app instance is created.
   - `dotenv` is used to load environment variables (optional for MongoDB connection).
   - The Mongoose connection to a MongoDB database is commented out. Uncomment it for database integration.

2. **User Routes:**
   - A separate router file (`userRoutes.js`) is used to manage user-related API endpoints.
   - The `/users` GET endpoint is defined:
     - `cors()` middleware allows cross-origin requests.
     - `express.json()` middleware parses incoming JSON data.
     - The `checkUserData` middleware validates the search query parameters format.
     - The `getUserByEmail` controller handles the user search logic.

3. **User Model (Optional):**
   - If using a database, the `userModel.js` file defines the user schema and model using Mongoose.

4. **Middleware (`checkUserData`):**
   - The `checkUserData` middleware validates the search query parameters using a function from `validUserData.js`.
   - It uses `tryCatchWrapper` (from `utils.js`) to handle potential errors during validation.

5. **`getUserByEmail` Controller:**
   - The `getUserByEmail` controller handles the user search logic:
     - It currently uses a simulated delay (replace with actual data access logic).
     - It returns a JSON response with either a success message and user data or a "User not found" message.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - A global error handler catches any unhandled errors and returns appropriate error responses.
   - Specific error handling is implemented in the `checkUserData` middleware for invalid user data.
